	abstract = {The use of infrared lasers to power optical-scale lithographically fabricated particle accelerators is a developing area of research that has garnered increasing interest in recent years. The physics and technology of this approach is reviewed, which is referred to as dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). In the DLA scheme operating at typical laser pulse lengths of 0.1 to 1 ps, the laser damage fluences for robust dielectric materials correspond to peak surface electric fields in the GV/m regime. The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons) for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required pulse energies are consistent with tabletop microJoule class lasers. Combined with the very high (MHz) repetition rates these lasers can provide, the DLA approach appears promising for a variety of applications, including future high-energy physics colliders, compact light sources, and portable medical scanners and radiative therapy machines.},

	abstract = {The enormous size and cost of current state-of-the-art accelerators based on conventional radio-frequency technology has spawned great interest in the development of new acceleration concepts that are more compact and economical. Micro-fabricated dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are an attractive approach, because such dielectric microstructures can support accelerating fields one to two orders of magnitude higher than can radio-frequency cavity-based accelerators. DLAs use commercial lasers as a power source, which are smaller and less expensive than the radio-frequency klystrons that power today’s accelerators. In addition, DLAs are fabricated via low-cost, lithographic techniques that can be used for mass production. However, despite several DLA structures having been proposed recently1,2,3,4, no successful demonstration of acceleration in these structures has so far been shown. Here we report high-gradient (beyond 250 MeV m−1) acceleration of electrons in a DLA. Relativistic (60-MeV) electrons are energy-modulated over 563 ± 104 optical periods of a fused silica grating structure, powered by a 800-nm-wavelength mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. The observed results are in agreement with analytical models and electrodynamic simulations. By comparison, conventional modern linear accelerators operate at gradients of 10–30 MeV m−1, and the first linear radio-frequency cavity accelerator was ten radio-frequency periods (one metre) long with a gradient of approximately 1.6 MeV m−1 (ref. 5). Our results set the stage for the development of future multi-staged DLA devices composed of integrated on-chip systems. This would enable compact table-top accelerators on the MeV–GeV (106–109 eV) scale for security scanners and medical therapy, university-scale X-ray light sources for biological and materials research, and portable medical imaging devices, and would substantially reduce the size and cost of a future collider on the multi-TeV (1012 eV) scale.},

These fields can drive the bulk dielectric beyond its linear response, and break the phase synchronicity between the accelerating field and the electrons. We show how control of the pulse dispersion can be used to compensate the effect of self-phase modulation and maximize the energy gain in the laser accelerator.In our experiment, a high brightness 8MeV e-beam is used to probe accelerating fields of 1.8GV/m in a 'grating-reset' dielectric structure illuminated by a 45fs laser pulse with a fluence of 0.7J/cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$.},

The acceleration gradient (or particle energy gain per unit length) is an important ﬁgure of merit. To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we explore the adjoint variable method, a highly eﬃcient technique used to compute the sensitivity of an objective with respect to a large number of parameters. With this formalism, the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient of a dielectric structure with respect to its entire spatial permittivity distribution is calculated by the use of only two full-ﬁeld electromagnetic simulations, the original and ‘adjoint’. The adjoint simulation corresponds physically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the accelerator gap and radiating. Using this formalism, we perform numerical optimizations aimed at maximizing acceleration gradients, which generate fabricable structures of greatly improved performance in comparison to previously examined geometries.},

Based on computational modeling, in the relativistic regime, our laser delivery system is estimated to provide 21 keV of energy gain over an acceleration length of 192 um with a single laser input, corresponding to a 108 MV/m acceleration gradient. The system may achieve 1 MeV of energy gain over a distance less than 1 cm by sequentially illuminating 49 identical structures. These findings are verified by detailed numerical simulation and modeling of the subcomponents and we provide a discussion of the main constraints, challenges, and relevant parameters in regards to on-chip laser coupling for dielectric laser accelerators.},

Our adjoint design optimization is applied to a Silicon photonics Y-junction splitter that had previously been investigated by stochastic methods. Owing to the speed of calculating shape derivatives within the adjoint method, convergence is much faster, within a larger design space.

We now know such systems could perform operations well beyond the classical optics of lenses and mirrors; indeed, any legal linear optical operation can be constructed from a mesh of two-beam interferometers [1,2]. One recently demonstrated example [3] is separating arbitrary overlapping orthogonal beams, without fundamental loss. Surprisingly, not only is there a simple way of designing such meshes, but the mesh can even design itself, without any calculations, opening up a new field of self-configuring, self-correcting, and self-stabilizing optics [1-3], and these meshes are well-suited to silicon photonics and possibly nanophotonic implementations. Potential applications include mode multiplexing/demultiplexing in telecommunications, microwave photonics, self-aligning beam couplers, automatic tracking of targets, automatically finding the best channels through a scattering optical system, networks for quantum applications, and many others. This different way of looking at optics has also led to a surprising fundamental advance in rewriting and extending Kirchhoff’s law of thermal radiation [4]. [1] D. A. B.

The resistance proﬁle is engineered using different dopant concentrations to obtain localized heat generation and maximize the overlap between the optical mode and the high temperature regions of the structure, while simultaneously minimizing optical loss due to free-carrier absorption. A 61.6 µm long phase shifter was fabricated in a CMOS process with oxide cladding and two metal layers. The device features a phase-shifting efﬁciency of 24.77 ± 0.43 mW/π and a -3 dB modulation bandwidth of 130.0 ± 5.59 kHz; the insertion loss measured for 21 devices across an 8-inch wafer was only 0.23 ± 0.13 dB.

However, the electron energy gain is limited by the short interaction length between the laser pulses and the electron bunch for previously reported DLAs. This paper numerically investigates the dual-grating DLAs driven by a pulse-front-tilted (PFT) laser which extends the interaction length and boosts the electrons energy gain. The optical system to generate the PFT laser beam is also studied in detail. By two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations we show that such a PFT laser effectively increases the energy gain by more than 100\% as compared to that of a normally incident laser beam.},

This design increases the accelerating gradients to more than double those of reported quartz grating accelerators, thereby reducing the input laser fluence by 60\% for the same accelerating gradient. With a 100 fs pulsed laser, our silicon buried gratings can achieve a maximum gradient of 1.1 GV/m, indicating that these accelerators have potential for numerous electron-accelerator applications.},

The main application we have in mind is the monitoring of conducting contaminant plumes out of surface and borehole electromagnetic imaging data. The essential feature of the method developed here is the use of adjoint ﬁelds for the reconstruction task, combined with a splitting of the data into smaller groups which deﬁne subproblems of the inversion problem. The method works iteratively, and can be considered as a nonlinear generalization of the algebraic reconstruction technique in x-ray tomography. Starting out from some initial guess for the conductivity distribution, an update for this guess is computed by solving one forward and one adjoint problem of the 3D Maxwell system at a time. Numerical experiments are performed for a layered background medium in which one or two localized (3D) inclusions are immersed. These have to be monitored out of surface to borehole and cross-borehole electromagnetic data. We show that the algorithm is able to recover a single inclusion in the earth which has high contrast to the background, and to distinguish between two separated inclusions in the earth given certain borehole geometries.},

It is shown that the error has to be back-propagated through the adjoint model of the system and that the gradient can only be obtained after a delay. A faster version, accelerated back propagation, that eliminates this delay, is also developed. Various schemes including the sensitivity method are studied to update the weights of the network using these gradients. Motivated by the Lyapunov approach and the adjoint model, the predictive back propagation and its variant, targeted back propagation, are proposed. A further refinement, predictive back propagation with filtering is then developed, where the states of the model are also updated. The convergence of this scheme is assured. It is shown that it is sufficient to back propagate as many time steps as the order of the system for convergence. As a preamble, convergence of on-line batch and sample-wise updates in feedforward models is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach.},

The device has a total coupling efficiency that is similar to standard focusing grating couplers. Furthermore, a channel non-uniformity below 1.1 dB has been obtained. By studying the alignment sensitivity, we found that for high splitting uniformity, a careful positioning of the fiber is necessary.

Confinement in the other direction is obtained by a single conventional quadrupole magnet. Within the small aperture of 420 nm we find the matched distributions, which allow an optimized injection into pure transport, bunching, and accelerating structures. The combination of these resembles the photonics analogue of the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ), but since our setup is entirely twodimensional, it can be manufactured on a microchip by lithographic techniques.

	abstract = {Comprehensive and complete, this overview provides a single-volume treatment of key algorithms and theories. The author provides clear explanations of all theoretical aspects, with rigorous proof of most results. The two-part treatment begins with the derivation of optimality conditions and discussions of convex programming, duality, generalized convexity, and analysis of selected nonlinear programs. The second part concerns techniques for numerical solutions and unconstrained optimization methods, and it presents commonly used algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization problems. This graduate-level text requires no advanced mathematical background beyond elementary calculus, linear algebra, and real analysis. 1976 edition. 58 figures. 7 tables.},
